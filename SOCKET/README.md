🧦 SOCK: Super Obedient Calculation Keeper

GCC Magic 🧙‍♂️: gcc multiplication_server.c -o server → Turns boring .c into a mighty executable!
Client Assembly 🛠️: gcc multiplication_client.c -o client → Builds the sidekick to talk to the server.
Summon the Beast 👹: ./server → Starts the server, waiting for clients like a hungry monster.
Mission: Multiply ✖️: ./client 5 7 → Sends numbers to the server for instant multiplication magic.
Automation for Lazy Legends 😴: bash run.sh → Why type? Let a script do the work!
Scripting Superpowers 🚀: run.sh compiles, launches, tests, and maybe even brews coffee.
Sockets = Superpowers ⚡: The server listens, the client whispers, math happens over magic tubes.
Edge Case Chaos 🏴‍☠️: What happens if you multiply by zero? Or send words instead of numbers? 🤔
Time is Money ⏳: Measure how fast it calculates. If it’s too slow, blame your CPU!
Now You’re a SOCK Star ⭐: Run it, break it, fix it, laugh, and share with a friend!
